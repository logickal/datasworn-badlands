# Datasworn - Badlands

Capturing the [Badlands](https://kstetson.itch.io/ironsworn-badlands) expansion for the [Ironsworn](https://ironswornrpg.com) RPG in [Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn/tree/v0.1.0-prerelease) format.

All content originally by Keith Stetson (Badlands) and Shawn Tomkin (Ironsworn).

Originally created for use with the [Iron Vault Obsidian Plugin](https://ironvault.quest), but should ultimately be usable anywhere Datasworn Data is used.

This is a work in progress and is still lacking some assets (notably companions), and most of the Oracle tables.
